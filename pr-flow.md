## Flow to create Pull Requests

- Each pull request should be reviewd by at least two people,
  execluding the author.
- Its encouraged to open pull requests as early as possible so we can
  review the code and track progress in a more precise way.
- In the pull request add description about the problem you are
  trying to solve and HOW you did it.
- Its encouraged that each pull requests resolves a single problem. if
  you need to do some linting or css changes, or any other small
  changes, please open a separate pr for each.
- When reviewing pull requests, its encouraged to checkout to the
  branch locally and test/inspect the code.
- after 2 approvals the author of the PR need to merge
- the owner of the PR/ task is responsible for the good success and deployment of the PR, that means that if there is some blocker,
  the author need to take necessary actions to move the PR forward
